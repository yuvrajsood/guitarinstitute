    <p style="text-align: left;font-size:20px;padding:60px;">Guitar, plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The early guitar was narrower and deeper than
        the modern guitar, with a less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;font-size:20px;padding:60px;margin-top:-120px;">The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single, that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly; the bridge thus sustained the direct pull of the strings. In the belly
        was a circular sound hole, often ornamented with a carved wooden rose. The 16th-century guitar was tuned C–F–A–D′, the tuning of the centre four courses of the lute and of the vihuela.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;padding:60px;margin-top:-100px;">From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned
        E–A–D–G–B–E′, still the standard tuning. The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head with rear tuning pegs; in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the tuning pegs. The early tied-on gut frets
        were replaced by built-on ivory or metal frets in the 18th century. The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and several metal or ivory frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century the fingerboard was raised
        slightly above the level of the belly and was extended across it to the edge of the sound hole. In the 19th century the guitar’s body also underwent changes that resulted in increased sonority. It became broader and shallower, with an extremely
        thin soundboard. Internally, the transverse bars reinforcing the soundboard were replaced by radial bars that fanned out below the sound hole. The neck, formerly set into a wood block, was formed into a brace, or shoe, that projected a short distance
        inside the body and was glued to the back; this gave extra stability against the pull of the strings.</p>

                    <h2>Holding a Guitar</h2>
                    <p>The guitar can be played in many positions, but some positions are clearly more efficient than others. The choice of position is personal, but clear guidelines exist. Some basic considerations in determining a chosen playing position
                        include:
                    </p>
                    <p>the physical stability of the instrument</p>
                    <p>ensuring the freedom of both hands such that they have thorough access to the instrument and can meet all technical demands without having to support the instrument</p>
                    <p>elimination of general muscular tension in the assumed body position. While it is natural for a beginner to experience fatigue in the muscles of his hands and arms, you must be careful to sit straight and not cause damage to your spine
                        and waist. If you do experience pain in those regions it is possible that the position is harmful and must be changed to prevent damage.</p>

                    <h2>Sitting Position</h2>
                    <p>Sit up straight on a chair or stool, with your left foot on a footrest approximately 10-20 cm in height. Place the waist of your guitar on your left thigh. Rest your right forearm on the top front edge of the guitar's lower bout so
                        that it is comfortable and allows you to easily strum the strings over the soundhole. The guitar headstock should approximately be at head level, which corresponds to an inclination of the guitar neck of about 45 degrees. Your
                        left hand should be presented to the guitar neck and fretboard such that the thumb is behind the neck and all three segments of the fingers are forward of the edge of the fingerboard. Shoulders should be level and relaxed, and
                        it helps to be leaning forward slightly. Most people should feel comfortable and able to stay in this position with little effort. If you cannot, something may not be right. As an alternative to using a footstool, you can use some
                        sort of guitar support between your left leg and guitar. This also allows for good alignment of the spine and an efficient. </p>

                    <h2>How to Use a Pick Hand</h2>
                    <p>In order to advance with the guitar, it is very important to properly use your picking, or impact hand. This should almost always be your dominant hand.</p>
                    <p>Your hand should "float" at a comfortable height above the sound hole, and you should be keeping your wrist straight or slightly bent. You should always be ready for movement in either direction, and your wrist should not touch the
                        strings as you are strumming (unless you are doing some sort of muting technique). You can use your fourth finger to brace against your guitar, but this is considered bad in the long term; this is like a crutch, and you are limiting
                        the potential you can get from practicing with your whole arm. For example, even though the brace will let you pick notes faster, it sometimes limit your ability to play complex rhythms using chords. While it might be good to practice
                        using your fourth finger for a brace sometimes, you will become a better guitar player if you don't brace yourself.</p>

                        find that you carry the responsibility of many of the solos. However, being part of a band and having the understanding of the talents and skills of other groupmates, there will be times that you highlight them as well. Other guitarists

                        of different tones. That’ll be the pedalboard taking over! A lot of players will use a range of different guitar pedals to shape their tone and add things they can’t do with a guitar and amp alone. Pedals come in all shapes and
                        sizes and do a range of things from overdrives and distortions to delays, reverbs, choruses, pitch shifters and everything else you can imagine. There is no easy way to start out on your pedal quest and there is no right or wrong.

                    <h2>Legato</h2>
                    <p>Legato is a technique where you use your fretting hand to play multiple notes without picking each one. You would be familiar with this on a smaller scale as hammer ons, pull offs and slides. Yet, many prolific players such as Paul
                        Gilbert and Richie Kotzen use legato to great effect by maximizing its use across full licks. Paul Gilbert’s lesson here really emphasizes why this is more than just learning how to hammer on/pull off. To get fretting hand legato
                        smooth, it requires practice and strength. There are some great resources out their for improving Legato, including Leigh’s Left Hand Legato Workout that is worth checking out.</p>
